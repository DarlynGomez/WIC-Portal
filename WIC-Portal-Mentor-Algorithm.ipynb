    "# Multi Agent Mentorship Matchign Algortihm Tester\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document I will test using four speciialized AI agents that will conduct natural conversations with a \"BMCC student\" in attempt to build deep personality profiles that will be used to match them with their top 5 mentors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Traditional mentor matching has several issues surrounding the surface level matching algorithms which involve simple categorical variables inputted by the student through static forms. This can often miss the nuances in the student personality, mentor preferences, learning styles, and other actual needs to succeed within BMCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution** - Students will use a simple UI that will them to participate in a deep 10 minute conversation with four specialized agents.\n",
    "1. **Learning Style Analyzer** - Inquires about situations in which student retained information best to infer their learning styles, confidence level in their program, and where they may need support\n",
    "2. **Career Objective Analyzer** - Discusses career goals and passions to pin point the targetted future centered help they may needed and professional settings the student is drawn too (like mathematic heavy, fintech, etc)\n",
    "3. **Personal Circumstances Analyzer** - Deep dives into external factors that may hinder students mentorship progress, education, or confidence levels. Also picks up on communication preferences and needs beyond academic support.\n",
    "4. **Personality Profile Summarizer** - Analyzes all conversation data and converts it into a readable and comprehensive profile in markdown format which includes the top 5 mentor matches.\n",

I'm guessing that's what drives your passion for computer science - wanting to create solutions that make a tangible impact. Can you tell me more about how you felt when Jose helped you with the React hooks concept? Did he explain things in a way that made sense to you, or was it more like \"aha, I get it now\"?\n",

       "Potential Challenges:\n",
       "- Limited learning style compatibility due to James' structured guidance approach, which may not suit Maria's need for hands-on project-based learning.\n",
       "- Potential mismatch in communication style due to James' more professional and detailed approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recommended Meeting Structure:\n",
       "- Bi-weekly video calls to discuss career direction and provide guidance\n",
       "- Quarterly \"career development workshops\" where James shares insights on cybersecurity best practices\n",
       "- Monthly \"office hours\" for Maria to receive guidance on career-related topics\n",

       "Overall, Sarah Chen's compatibility score is the highest due to her alignment with Maria's web development goals and learning style. Carlos Mendez and Dr. Lisa Kim are close second and third, respectively, despite some potential challenges in their mentorship approach. James Wilson's compatibility score is lower due to potential mismatches in communication style and learning pace."
